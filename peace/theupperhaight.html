Here Comes The Sun

<p class="here">
Here comes the sun
</br>
doo-doo-doo-doo
</br>
here comes the sun
</br>
And I say it's all right
</br>
Little darling
</br>
it's been a long cold lonely winter
</br>
Little darling
</br>
it feels like years since it's been here
</br>
Here comes the sun
</br>
doo-doo-doo-doo
</br>
here comes the sun
</br>
And I say it's all right
</br>
Little darling
</br>
the smiles returning to the faces
</br>
Little darling
</br>
it seems like years since it's been here
</br>
Here comes the sun
</br>
doo-doo-doo-doo
</br>
here comes the sun
</br>
And I say it's all right
</br>
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
</br>
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
</br>
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
</br>
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
</br>
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
</br>
Little darling
</br>
I feel that ice is slowly melting
</br>
Little darling
</br>
it seems like years since it's been clear
</br>
Here comes the sun
</br>
doo-doo-doo-doo
</br>
here comes the sun
</br>
And I say it's all right

Here comes the sun
</br>
doo-doo-doo-doo
</br>
here comes the sun
</br>
It's all right,
</br>
It's all right

At the same time, these social networks tend to treat native text and pictures — things

<h1 class="b2">
that are directly posted to them — with a lot more respect than those that reside on

<h1 class="b3">
outside web pages. One photographer friend explained to me how the images he uploads

<h1 class="b4">
directly to Facebook receive a large number of likes, which in turn means they appear

<h1 class="b5">
 more on other people’s news feeds. On the other hand, when he posts a link to the same

 picture somewhere outside Facebook — his now-dusty blog, for instance — the images are

  much less visible to Facebook itself,and therefore get far fewer likes.The cycle reinforces

<h1 class="b8">
 itself. Some networks, like Twitter, treat hyperlinks a little better.Others, insecure social</h1>

 services, are far more paranoid.Instagram—owned by Facebook—doesn’t allow its audiences

<h1 class="b10">
 to leave whatsoever. You can put up a web address alongside your photos, but it won’t go

<h1 class="b11">
 anywhere. Lots of people start their daily online routine in these cul de sacs offf social

 media,and their journeys end there.Many don’t even realize that they’re using the Internet
