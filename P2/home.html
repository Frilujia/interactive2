 De Stijl (/də ˈstaɪl/), Dutch for "The Style", also known as Neoplasticism, was a Dutch artistic movement founded by the painter and architect Theo van Doesburg in 1917 in Leiden. Proponents of De Stijl advocated pure abstraction and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to vertical and horizontal, using only black, white and primary colors.
